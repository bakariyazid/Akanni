            <h1 class="hy"> SCHOOL RULES AND REGULATIONS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Koranic schools often have rules that include: </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 1. VISITORS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> School is a place of business. Visitors are not permitted
                during the school days. On rare occasions, and with a prior
                24 hour notice, a visitor's pass may be issued by administration.
                No visitors are to be admitted to any class without such a pass.
                Even with a pass, an individual teacher can refuse to admit a visitor
                if the visit would be inappropriate. On entering the school, parents
                and guardians are asked to check in with the Main Office. </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 2. COMMUNICATION WITH THE SCHOOL </h1>
            <p class="tb"> The primary method of communication between the school and parents/students
                is by e-mail. The school communicates with parents through the email addresses
                stored in the student's record. When corresponding with the school the sender
                must type the full name of the student and the student's grade in the email body. </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 3. COMMUNICATING ANNOUNCEMENTS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> All announcements are sent to the school's mailing list, and placed on the Board
                section on the Homepage of the school's website. Parent emails are added to the school
                mailing list automatically at the beginning of the school year. There is also a subscribe
                button on the Homepage allowing parents to add their personal emails to the mailing list. </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 3. MEETINGS </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Meetings between parents and the school administrators or teachers are scheduled by e-mail.
                Parents requesting a meeting must provide the name of the student, grade, and a brief description
                of the purpose of the meeting in the email. </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 4. FEES AND FINANCES </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students must pay the fees in full at registration time as per the fee payment instructions
                provided at registration time. The registration fee (and any other administrative fees) is

                individuals involved in an incident to participate in its resolution;Teach students positive
                behavioural skills to become independent, self-disciplined citizens in the school community and society
            </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 6. DRESS CODE </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students and staff are expected to follow Islamic
                dress codes, which may include wearing long pants
                and long-sleeved shirts. Girls may be encouraged
                to wear long skirts and head scarves. Your dressing
                should always be cleaned. </p>

            <h1 class="yh"> 12. ACADEMIC WORK </h1>
            <p class="tb"> Students are expected to work hard and look after their teaching environment.
                Cheating or plagiarism will result in disciplinary action. </p>

                them might face consequences and risks suspension, or even expulsion. This code of conduct
                has been developed to emphasize Islamic values and to cultivate a feeling of self-worth and
                self-discipline in students. It is an expression of the school's climate and its atmosphere
                for learning. A positive climate is an environment in which all students feel that they are
                encouraged to participate and are a valued part of the school. </p>

                of the misconduct, consequences vary and may include suspension and/or expulsion.</p>
            <p class="tb"> Misconduct will be dealt with by the teacher, then by the Section Supervisor or the head
                office as it warrants. The student will receive a warning for minor offences. Major offences
                will be dealt with directly by the Main Office. The student will be expelled upon receiving
                3 warnings during the school year. </p>
